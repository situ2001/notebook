## static keyword

How does the keyword static works?

其实一般就是用来遮掩隐藏的，因为用了static关键字的变量，它的作用域就不再是全局了，即使他被存于全局变量区域。然后另外一个就是静态地躺在了全局变量区里头，只被初始化一次。

## define vs typedef vs using

如果都是用来做type alias的话，就是这样（不过define还是别滥用

``` cpp
#define T std::int64_t
using T = std::int64_t;
typedef std::int64_t T;
```

typedef 为什么顺序有点不一样呢，可以直接想想C风格的struct

``` c
typedef struct 
{
    int foo;
    int bar;
} S;
```

## 只能重载为成员函数的运算符

答案来源: [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1132600/why-can-some-operators-only-be-overloaded-as-member-functions-other-as-friend-f)

摘抄原文如下，可能是为了一些情况的考虑，所以就禁止重载为非成员函数

> 1. The assignment `operator=()`. Allowing non-member assignments seems to open the door for operators hijacking assignments, e.g., by overloading for different versions of const qualifications. Given that assignment operators are rather fundamental that seems to be undesirable.
>
> 2. The function call `operator()()`. The function call and overloading rules are sufficiently complicated as is. It seems ill-advised to complicate the rules further by allowing non-member function call operators.
>
> 3. The subscript `operator[]()`. Using interesting index types it seems that could interfere with accesses to operators. Although there is little danger of hijacking overloads, there doesn't seem to be much gain but interesting potential to write highly non-obvious code.
>
> 4. The class member access `operator->()`. Off-hand I can't see any bad abuse of overloading this operator a non-member. On the other hand, I also can't see any. Also, the class member access operator has rather special rules and playing with potential overloads interfering with these seems an unnecessary complication.
