# Electron

## Essence

> Build cross-platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

Electron consists of three main pillars:

- Chromium for displaying web content.
- Node.js for working with the local filesystem and the operating system.
- Custom APIs for working with often-needed OS native functions.
